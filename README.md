Welcome to the Iris Flower Classification project repository! This project aims to demonstrate the process of building a machine learning model to classify iris flowers based on the famous Iris dataset. The dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, with four features each, making it a great starting point for learning and practicing machine learning techniques.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset is included in the `data` directory and is available in CSV format. It contains the following features for each iris sample:

- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width
- Target class (setosa, versicolor, or virginica)

## Requirements

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Scikit-learn 0.24 or higher

## Results

We have experimented with multiple machine learning algorithms on the Iris dataset and evaluated their performance. The best-performing model's accuracy is approximately 97%, making it suitable for practical applications.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to improve this project! If you have ideas for new algorithms, data visualizations, or any other enhancements, please open an issue or submit a pull request. Let's learn and grow together!
